Its a library that takes the users watched episodes and selected services and determines what streaming service to open on a given show when the user hits the play button.',

I moved to Kamloops for school, and landscaped in the summers. On the third year, I split time between my employer and a side business doing hedge trimming and yard revivals. It was that summer that I had the idea to move to Victoria and try to strike out a living doing software development.',
