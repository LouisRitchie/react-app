      description: 'Reelgood keeps track of your favourite shows and streaming services that youre subscribed to. I was a member of Reelgoods web team for one year. I wrote React code that interacted with tens of APIs, handling user auth and email tokens, data loading, updating user preferences, and so on. I also wrote the playback mechanism. Its a library that takes the users watched episodes and selected services and determines what streaming service to open on a given show when the user hits the play button.',
