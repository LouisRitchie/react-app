    description: 'Global Game Jam was a game development competition that I organized. I raised some $3000 from local companies and used it to pay for food and beverages for an entire weekend of game development. The event had 30 participants. I built a little brochure website in plain HTML, set up EventBrite for ticket sales, had T-shirts printed, registered a venue, and did everything else to get it off the ground.',
